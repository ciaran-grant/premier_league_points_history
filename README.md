# Premier League Points by Position per Season

This repository contains a jupyter notebook which aims to  investigate the following:

- How do points totals recently compare to early Premier League seasons?
- What has happened to the gap between the champions and relegation survivors?
- How many points do you tend to need to qualify for Europe recently?

League tables for each season have been pulled from www.fbref.com.
